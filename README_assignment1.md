<h1>White House Visitor Logs Project â€“ Data II</h1>

<i>by Caelainn Barr, Annie Waldman and Daniel Drepper</i>

<h3>Project Synopsis: </h3>
Our project looked at the relationship between lobbyists and White House visitors. What we were hoping to
understand was who were the most frequent lobbyists to the White House and who were the most frequent White House
that were visited.


<h3>Story Memo:</h3>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>

The White House visitor logs provide a lot of information about lobbyists who visit the White House.
When we compared a cleaned up list of registered lobbyists (from Sunlight Foundation database, see link below)
from 2012-2013 and compared it with the White House visitor logs, we were able to see which lobbyists were 
frequently visiting the White House. Additionally, we were able to see the White House workers that were 
most frequenctly visted, whom we designated White House "power brokers." Finally, we looked at which 
groups visiting the White House contained the greatest amount of lobbyists. 

Sunlight Foundation Database on Lobbyists:

<h4>Most Frequent Lobbyists:</h4>

After creating a master list of lobbyists from 2012-2013 from the Sunlight Foundation data, we compared that with
the visitor log, excluding any names that showed up in the tourist Group Tours. We are aware that we
still need to double check each visit of each lobbyist, and make sure that the visits correspond 
to the lobbyists and not a non-lobbyist name twin.

We found that the top 15 lobbyists with the most visits to the White House in 2012 and 2013 are:

<h5>Name and Total Visits for 2012-2013</h5>

Yvette Fontenot, 175 visits

Daniel Jones, 160 visits

Richard Miller, 114 visits

John Thomas, 97 visits

John Thompson, 96 visits

Thomas Richards, 93 visits

Thomas Maloney, 90 visits

Robert Ryan, 90 visits

Michael Smith, 86 visits

John Kelly, 84 visits

William Donovan, 77 visits

John Wilson, 77 visits

Rachel Thomas, 71 visits

John Brown, 69 visits

David Danielson, 66 visits 

From this list, it is difficult to say exactly what each lobbyist is lobbying for. However, we have the data from
opensecrets.org, and we are able to find out what companies, clients, issues, and bills are associated wtih each 
lobbyist.

Aside from looking at what each lobbyist is lobbying for, we would like to look more closely at the connection
between these lobbyists and the white house staff. Or we could look at with whom these lobbyists are entering 
the White House: Are there any networks of lobbyists with former employers in house or senate? Are there networks between
the lobbyists themselves? How do lobbyists use their former contacts, either with other lobbyists entering the White
House with them, or with the current White House Staff?

Additionally, we would also like to compare the visits of the lobbyists with news events and bills. If we could look 
at the visits of the top lobbyists on a timeline and compare it with the primary political news stories, it could
paint an interesting picture of the White House's relationships with lobbyists during crises and lulls.


<h4>Most Frequent Power Brokers:</h4>

We also found the people in the White House who received the most visits from lobbyist names, and we have called
them "Power Brokers". We excluded all group tours and all visits from lobbyists where no visitee was mentioned.

Here are the top 15 so-called "Power Brokers":

<h5>Name and Total Visits for 2012-2013</h5>
Potus, 1506 visits

Kyle Lierman, 540 visits

Potus/Flotus, 496 visits

Brad Jenkins, 404 visits

Heather Zichal, 361 visits

Jeanne Lambrew, 355 visits

Visitors Office, 243 visits

Karen Richardson, 230 visits

Elizabeth Fowler, 229 visits

Ari Matusiak, 213 visits

Victoria Mccullough, 210 visits

Jonathan Asen, 197 visits

Doug Mckalip, 196 visits

Victoria Espinel, 191 visits

Heather Foster, 190 visits

After we have this list of "power brokers," we can look at the background of some of them. It appears that some of these
current White House staff, with the exception of potus, flotus, and the visitor's office, have worked for lobbying firms
in the past. One telling example is Jeanne Lambrew. Jeann Lambrew worked from 2003 to 2009 for the "Center for American Progress".
Link: http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=29680. The Center lobbied among others for Obamacare. 
When Lambrew entered the White House in 2009, the lobbying expenditures of the Center rose from about $200k to about
$1 million a year for 2009 and 2010. Obamacare was signed into effect on March 23, 2010.

Jeanne Lambrew also worked for Obama's transition team, a team of 400 experts that looked at the work 
of government agencies before Obama took office: http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/transition.php?cycle=2008

To strengthen our story, we would like to find out how the "visitee" in the White House visitor logs is defined.
How large is the power of these so-called power brokers? Are they unimportant clerks, just signing in the lobbyists,
or are they organizers with more influence? Bottom line, there seems to be a story behind these names, 
especially by looking at the background of these people.


<h4>Most Frequent UIN Groups for Lobbyists:</h4>
We started to look at the dates when the most lobbyists entered the White House together, as illustrated by 
sharing a UIN number.

Here are the top 10 events that included lobbyist names:

<h5>UIN, Date, Possible Event, Location, and Total Number of Lobbyists</h5>

U83535: March 14, 2012; Prime Minister Cameron visit to the White House; South Lawn; 181 Lobbyists (out of 5730 people)

U55399: December 11, 2012; Mystery Event on State Floor; 90 Lobbyists (out of 758 people)

INAUG1: January 22, 2013; Inauguration Open Houses Access List at Residence; 87 Lobbyists (total amount of people NA)

U20020: July 4, 2012; Fourth of July Celebration on South Lawn; 65 Lobbyists (out of 3561 people)

U54728: December 3, 2012; Mystery Event on the State Floor; 59 Lobbyists (out of 1187 people)

U00736: June 2, 2013, Mystery Event State Floor (nothing on schedule); 57 Lobbyists (total amount of people NA)

U78890: February 19, 2013; President speaking on budget cuts related to the fiscal cliff at the South Court; 47 Lobbyists (out of 94 people)

U58472: December 18, 2013; Mystery Event at the Residence; 42 Lobbyists (out of 747 people)

U10495: May 30, 2012; Possible event: reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank at Old Executive Office Building; 42 Lobbyists (out of 181 people)

U82930: February 23, 2012, Mystery Event at the Old Executive Office Building, 40 Lobbyists (out of 184 people)


Some of these gatherings with dozens of lobbyists are not marked in the official calendar of the White House. 
There is little detailed information in the description about what events the lobbyists are attending. The above information
stems from White House Schudule on the corresponding day of the visits.

<h4>Next Steps:</h4>
The next steps would be to confirm that all the visits from lobbyists are actually visits from lobbyists and not their
name twins. Once we have confirmed and reconfirmed that the individuals we are working with are in fact lobbyisits, then
we would like to create a network graph that matches lobbyists to power brokers, to show the extensive ties between the
lobbying industry and the white house staff. 

This would also help us to find the most influential power brokers in the white house, and make it more accessible to 
readers.


<h4>One Important Fact About R:</h4>
One fact that we learned about R is how to compare two different databases. Although we knew that of course this was possible,
we didn't necessary have the ingrained mental roadmap in order to do this with ease.


<h4>Something We Were Not Sure About:</h4>
We were not yet sure on how to build a network, but we are hopeful that we will soon be able t confidently do so.
